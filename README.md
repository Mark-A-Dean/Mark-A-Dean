# About Mark ðŸ‘‹

## The Biz Background
I joined the **Department of Veterans Affairs** in 2006 through the TCF Internship program, graduating in 2009, and worked in the VISN 17 Office on the V17 data warehouse until 2012. I transitioned to the **Business Intelligence Service Line** (BISL) that June as a Data Architect in the CDW. In 2021, I moved into BISL's CDW Customer Engagement team and helped it get started before joining the **VHA Business Information Office** Revenue Operations team in April 2022.

Before public service, I was a R&D chemist in the automotive industry, and have worked in industrial warehouses organizing and managing inventory control. My degree is in Biology with advanced studies in Vertebrate Zoology, Ecology, Biogeography, and taxonomy.

- âš¡ Fun facts: I worked in the _Decaying Flesh Lab_ and was a bouncer during college. Although, neither job was as fun as it sounds.
