# About Mark ðŸ‘‹

## The Biz Background
I joined the **Department of Veterans Affairs** in 2006 through the TCF Internship program, graduating in 2009, and joining the VISN 17 Office staff. I transitioned to the **Business Intelligence Service Line** (BISL) in June 2012, starting with the CDW Architect Team and then moved into the new CDW Customer Engagement team in 2021. Before public service, I was a R&D chemist with an automotive company, and have worked in industrial warehouses (inventory control). My degree is in Biology with advanced studies in Vertebrate Zoology, Ecology, Biogeography, and taxonomy.

## Interests

> I would choose XSLT or Liquid to be my deserted island programming language. PowerShell is a nice polyglot that would be Huttese if XML were Galactic Basic.
> _Regex_? To me, it's a unique language with syntactical dialects.
